                    <p> Our project is constructed with a customized game engine, therefore, I contributed to the improvement of our own engine by recognizing the errors and solving them with engineers,
                        and by optimizing the existing gameplay systems and implementing new features.
                        Apart from that, I was also responsible to design the game level, and built the level blueprints independently. Besides, I organized more than 5 white-box tests for my levels,
                        ranking second in the company's historical records.
